# backupator
backupator makes folders and files copies from source directory to destination  

backupator makes folders and files (fobjects from now on) copies from origin to destination.
It only copies fobjects if they don't exsit. In case the files exist they are updated if the same files have different md5sum 
The program can be launched with the forced option (-f) to force the copy of the origin file to the destination
